CHANGELOG

0.2 Support for Django 1.4
----------------------------
Author: Krzysztof Dorosz <cypreess@gmail.com>

From Django 1.4 settings variable `ADMIN_MEDIA_PREFIX` became deprecated.
Please refer to:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.4/#django-contrib-admin

Thus it was broking displaying `move_up_down_links` method of `OrderedModelAdmin`.
Because in Django 1.4 pictures `arrow_up.gif` and `arrow_down.gif` are not available anymore,
images where converted to HTML signs &#x25B2; and &#x25BC; which brings backward compatibility,
as it does not require any additional settings variables.


0.1 Initial stable version
--------------------------
